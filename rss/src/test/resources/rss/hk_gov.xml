            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 4pm today (October 26), the CHP has recorded one new locally acquired case of chikungunya fever (CF), marking the first such case in Hong Kong. The CHP has initiated appropriate infection control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Latest case information<br />
----------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case involves an 82-year-old female living in Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin. She developed swollen and painful left ankle since October 18, and fever and limbs joint pain on October 22. She sought medical attention from a private doctor on the same day, and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital the following day (October 23). She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. The patient is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Qingyuan in Guangdong in late August but had no travel history during the incubation period (two to 12 days prior to onset). The case is classified as a local case. The patient has four household contacts who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Government&#39;s comprehensive follow-up actions<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the abovementioned local case, the CHP today has conducted inter-departmental meeting with various departments and relevant organisations, including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Wong Tai Sin District Office (WTSDO) and Hong Kong Housing Authority, to ensure that all units implement various preventive and control measures in a speedy and orderly manner.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 5pm yesterday, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 46 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. None of the 46 patients lives near the abovementioned local case. Given that the activity areas of the 82-year-old patient are primarily within the estate, the CHP cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified infected patient(s) in the area may have transmitted the virus to mosquitoes in the estate, leading to her infection. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHP is implementing prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. The CHP will arrange for laboratory testing&nbsp;if they presented with relevant symptoms. The CHP officers and District Services &amp; Community Care Teams&nbsp;(Care Teams) will contact about 8 000 households and carry out questionnaire surveys to understand and follow up their health conditions. The CHP urged the residents to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 1.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHP will hold an online live seminar at 8.30pm tonight. Doctors will explain the symptoms of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents. The CHP and WTSDO will organise a public health talk at the at Fung Tak Estate Community Centre at 8pm tomorrow (October 27) to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the CHP has set up a health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre, where assessments will be provided to residents with relevant symptoms from today. The CHP will also setup an inquiry hotline (2125 2373), which will operate from 9am to 8pm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHP, together with the FEHD, have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient&#39;s residence, conducted vector investigations and mosquito control operations to minimise the risk of local transmission. Furthermore, the CHP will issue letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and remaining them to be vigilant.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year. In fact, overall mosquito infestation indices this year are lower than that of the previous years. The mosquito infestation index in September was 2.5 per cent, which decreased significantly from 9.5 per cent in June. The index available for October also remains at a low level. Regarding the investigation area of the local case, the latest&nbsp;area gravidtrap index (AGI) in October was 1.7 per cent, while the AGI in September was 0.9 per cent, indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive. Among which, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, these measures include:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;</li>
	<li>carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and</li>
	<li>enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures. The Environment and Ecology Bureau will hold Steering Committee meeting to lead relevant departments to step up mosquito prevention and elimination measures; the district offices of the FEHD will hold interdepartmental meetings at district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WTSDO is working closely with the CHP to disseminate information on CF, including arranging Care Teams to distribute leaflets and surveys to each household unit, contact Link to facilitate the setup of a health consultation booth at the shopping centre nearby, and arranging health talk for the residents to be held tomorrow night.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Latest surveillance data<br />
-----------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.<br />
<br />
Preventive measures taken by the public<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients&#39; underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>read the label instructions carefully first;</li>
	<li>apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;</li>
	<li>apply on exposed skin and clothing;</li>
	<li>use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);</li>
	<li>apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;</li>
	<li>reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and</li>
	<li>in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHP&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public should call&nbsp;1823&nbsp;in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/6122.html" target="_blank">CHP</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.travelhealth.gov.hk/english/travel_related_diseases/chikungunyafever.html" target="_blank">Travel Health Service</a>, the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.travelhealth.gov.hk/english/outbreaknews/outbreaknews.html" target="_blank">Travel Health News</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/38927.html" target="_blank">tips for using insect repellents</a>, and the CHP&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection?_rdr" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/centreforhealthprotection/" target="_blank">Instagram Account</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>, and also the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/mosquito-leading.html" target="_blank">Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page</a>&nbsp;of the FEHD.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/26/P2025102600593_photo_1315834.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/26/P2025102600593_photo_1315834.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/26/P2025102600593_photo_1315835.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/26/P2025102600593_photo_1315835.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/26/P2025102600593_photo_1315836.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/26/P2025102600593_photo_1315836.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/26/P2025102600593_photo_1315837.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/26/P2025102600593_photo_1315837.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹In response to claims by businesses that menstrual blood can be collected using sanitary pads, then self-sampled and mailed to laboratory for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing, the Department of Health (DH) today (October 26) reminded members of the public that there is currently insufficient scientific evidence, both locally and internationally, to confirm the reliability of using menstrual blood for cervical screening.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong, cervical cancer was the ninth most common female cancer in 2022, with 522 new cases and 167 deaths. To reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, the Government has all along implemented a multi-pronged strategy. This includes providing free HPV vaccinations to eligible Primary Five schoolgirls under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme since the 2019/20 school year by the DH; launching the Cervical Screening Programme in 2004; and promoting and enhancing health education through various channels to further increase screening coverage and public awareness of cervical cancer prevention.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the recommendation of the Cancer Expert Working Group on Cancer Prevention and Screening (CEWG), the DH adopted HPV testing using cervical cells as the primary approach of cervical screening for women aged 30 to 64 since April 2023. For women aged 25 to 29, in view of their higher prevalence of transient HPV infection, HPV testing may lead to unnecessary follow-up test and medical procedures. The CEWG recommended that women in this age group continue to undergo cervical screening by cervical cytology (also known as cervical smear or Pap smear).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to healthcare professionals collecting cervical samples for cytology or HPV testing, the World Health Organization recommended that vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing as another reliable method for cervical screening. Hence, from June 2024, the DH launched a Pilot Scheme on HPV Testing of Self-collected Samples at 11 Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) that provide family planning services in order to explore the feasibility and acceptability of vaginal HPV self-sampling.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding self-collected menstrual blood or urine samples, the DH noted that there is currently insufficient scientific evidence in Hong Kong or internationally to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of such cervical screening method. The DH will continue to review the latest scientific evidence in this field. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DH stressed that all screening methods have their limitations, including the potential for false negative or false positive results. Therefore, screening results should only be used as a reference and cannot substitute professional diagnosis by medical practitioners. Members of the public who have concerns about their screening results should consult healthcare professionals to develop appropriate health assessment plan based on their personal health conditions and needs, and to undergo examination at suitable medical institutions. Under the Medical Registration Ordinance (Cap. 161), any medical diagnosis must be made by a registered medical practitioner. If, during the process, the medical practitioner deem it necessary for the patient to undergo laboratory tests or examinations, the medical practitioner may either conduct such tests or examinations himself/herself or refer the tests or examinations to a registered medical laboratory technologist to perform. Under the Allied Health Professions Ordinance (Cap. 359) and its subsidiary legislation, a registered medical laboratory technologist shall not perform any laboratory tests or examinations for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment unless referred by a registered medical practitioner. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women aged 25 to 64 who have had sexual experience should consult healthcare professionals to select and undergo appropriate cervical screening methods regularly. Women planning to receive cervical screening at any of the MCHCs under the DH may make an appointment via the 24-hour hotline at 3166 6631.

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Toast to Success: Hong Kong Top Travel Agent Awards Celebration &amp; Gala Dinner of 2025 Wine and Dine Festival today (October 25):<br />
<br />
Michael (Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong), Rosanna (Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law), Peter (Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Dr Peter Lam), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Good evening.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A very warm welcome to the Tasting Room, and the Hong Kong Wine &amp; Dine Festival, a world of fabulous dining and imbibing, day and night. I hope you brought your appetite. This gala evening features an eight-course dinner with splendid wine pairings, from Bordeaux and Xinjiang&#39;s Turpan Valley.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For that, and a great deal more, my thanks to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. As Peter noted, tonight is about more than fine wine and culinary magic. It&#39;s also a celebration of collaboration, of connection.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On this good evening, I&#39;m pleased to welcome leaders from the financial and business sectors, as well as MICE (meetings, incentive travels, conventions and exhibitions) partners from around the world. Each of you shares a passion for excellence and the promise of partnership. That creates an ideal setting to make new friends, build lasting ties and look to Hong Kong for your future.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The momentum in our tourism sector is truly encouraging. In the first nine months of this year, we welcomed over 36 million visitors from around the world, up 12 per cent year on year. And the number of international visitors increased by 16 percent. MICE is the fastest recovering segment.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visitors added more than HK$11 billion to our economy&nbsp; Ì¶&nbsp; a clear testament to the value and impact of hosting business events here.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than a pillar of the economy, tourism brings our city&#39;s story to dazzling life, life you can see and experience, first-hand, for yourself.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hong Kong is the events capital of Asia for good reason. This year alone, our calendar is packed with more than 200 major events. We expect they will attract some 2.3 million visitors, generating over US$1 billion in spending.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beyond business, our city features a wide and welcome range of arts and culture, sports, entertainment and other leisure events throughout the year. The Wine &amp; Dine Festival is a prime example, a happy celebration of Hong Kong&#39;s unique East-meets-West culture. An enticing opportunity, too, to experience another side of Hong Kong &ndash; one that is festive, fun and full of delicious surprise.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We&#39;re working to create a continuing buzz, one great, city-wide festival that never ends. Our goal is simple - to give visitors reason after remarkable reason to stay longer, explore deeper, spend more and keep coming back.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we&#39;re building for the future, locking in long-term partnerships to ensure that these signature events become an essential part of Hong Kong&#39;s story.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our new, multi-year deal with LIV Golf, for example, brings the world&#39;s top golfers, and their fans, right here to our city.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We&#39;re also deepening our collaboration with Art Basel, reinforcing Hong Kong&#39;s role as the region&#39;s exclusive host city for the high-profile arts extravaganza.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s also part of our &quot;Tourism is Everywhere&quot; drive, one we&#39;re bringing to bright life, leveraging the city&#39;s distinctive culture, creativity and energy to attract visitors from around the world. And each of you plays an important role in realising that ambitious goal.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I invite you to become our &quot;Tourism Ambassadors&quot;, helping us share the authentic and inspiring story of Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is just a few minutes away. I wish you all a memorable evening and a delightful stay here in Hong Kong, Asia&#39;s World City and event capital. Culinary capital, too!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And for our local friends, please mark your diary for another event - the Legislative Council election on December 7. It is an important moment for our future.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you very much.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500572_photo_1315824.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500572_photo_1315824.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500572_photo_1315825.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500572_photo_1315825.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 25), two new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.<br />
<br />
Latest case information<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first case involves a 74-year-old female living in Kowloon City District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Foshan in Guangdong between October 3 and 13. She developed joint pain and rash since October 20. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital yesterday (October 24) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient is now in stable condition.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient has one household contact, who travelled with her to Foshan, is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other case involves a 72-year-old male living in Shatin District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between October 10 and 23. He developed a fever, joint pain and rash since October 23. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales Hospital yesterday and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient is now in stable condition.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patient has one household contact, who is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since both patients stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation period, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP&#39;s epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.<br />
<br />
Latest surveillance data<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 46 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. Among which, a patient passed away, while conditions of other patients are mild.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients&#39; underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.<br />
<br />
Continuously strengthening prevention and control<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;</li>
	<li>carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and</li>
	<li>enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.</li>
</ul>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD&#39;s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, the CHP&#39;s Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>read the label instructions carefully first;</li>
	<li>apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;</li>
	<li>apply on exposed skin and clothing;</li>
	<li>use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);</li>
	<li>apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;</li>
	<li>reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and</li>
	<li>in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹â€‹The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The public should call&nbsp;1823&nbsp;in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/6122.html" target="_blank">CHP</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.travelhealth.gov.hk/english/travel_related_diseases/chikungunyafever.html" target="_blank">Travel Health Service</a>, the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.travelhealth.gov.hk/english/outbreaknews/outbreaknews.html" target="_blank">Travel Health News</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/38927.html" target="_blank">tips for using insect repellents</a>, and the CHP&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection?_rdr" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/centreforhealthprotection/" target="_blank">Instagram Account</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>, and also the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/mosquito-leading.html" target="_blank">Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page</a>&nbsp;of the FEHD.]]>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (October 25) strongly disapproved of and opposed recent remarks by individual members of the United States (US) Senate Committee on Foreign Relations regarding the case endangering national security involving Lai Chee-ying and the treatment provided to him during his custody, including absurd and fact-twisting comments intended to pervert the course of justice. Their malicious intentions to smear and attack the HKSAR Government and challenge the bottom line of the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle are blatantly obvious and must be sternly denounced to set the record straight.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, &quot;The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that as the legal proceedings involving Lai Chee-ying are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the case in an attempt to interfere with the court to exercise judicial power independently, which might otherwise constitute perverting the course of justice. The suggestion that any persons or organisations with certain backgrounds should be immune from legal sanctions for their illegal acts and activities is tantamount to granting such persons privileges to break the law and is totally contrary to the spirit of the rule of law. External forces continue to distort the truth, blatantly discredit the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR. The HKSAR Government strongly urges relevant US politicians to respect the basic principles of the rule of law and judicial independence and immediately stop the above despicable political manipulation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spokesman said, &quot;The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support will be provided. If inmates require further examination and treatment, they will be referred to specialist medical staff or to public hospitals for further follow-up. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected. The CSD also adopts the above arrangements when handling matters related to Lai Chee-ying, which are no different from those applicable to other PICs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;During an earlier open court hearing, senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that the correctional institutions arrange daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical care he receives there. The Court commended the CSD while the Department of Justice stated that the prosecution is equally concerned about Lai Chee-ying&#39;s health and well-being. Therefore, the CSD has arranged for a professional medical team to be on standby on the spot, ready to respond to any emergency immediately if needed. External forces and anti-China media chose to turn a blind eye to these facts, and continued to repeat lies and engage in despicable operations. We must sternly denounce their wrongdoings.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We must once again point out the fact that the arrangement for Lai Chee-ying&#39;s removal from association from other PICs has all along been made at his own request and approved by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law. The remarks by these external forces regarding Lai Chee-ying&#39;s solitary confinement are completely fact-twisting, reflecting a malicious intention to smear and attack the HKSAR Government.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The HKSAR will continue to resolutely discharge the responsibility of safeguarding national security, effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities that endanger national security in accordance with the law, and safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people in accordance with the law at the same time. The HKSAR Government strongly urges all external forces to immediately stop interfering in the HKSAR&#39;s internal affairs and the independent exercise of judicial power by the courts of the HKSAR,&quot; the spokesman emphasised.]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The 2025 Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Legal Professional Examination (GBA Examination) was held today (October 25).<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress&#39; authorisation of the State Council to conduct a pilot scheme in 2020, the GBA Examination has been held five times. Currently, over 620 Hong Kong and Macao legal practitioners have passed the GBA Examination and obtained the Lawyer&#39;s License (Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area) to provide legal services in the nine Mainland municipalities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) on specified civil and commercial matters to which the Mainland laws apply.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, said, &quot;The GBA has the unique advantage of &#39;one country, two systems and three jurisdictions&#39;. GBA lawyers are dually qualified and can play an important role in facilitating the construction of the rule of law in the GBA as well as contributing to the country&#39;s high-quality development. The Department of Justice will continue to support the authorities including the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Justice of Guangdong Province in their work to take forward the development of the GBA lawyers scheme, and also maintain communication with the legal sector to assist GBA lawyers in their business development.&quot;]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹The Labour Department (LD) and the Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) jointly held an occupational safety seminar at the Kowloon Masjid and Islamic Centre today (October 25). The seminar elaborated on safety precautions that various industries should take while working, and demonstrated the use of appropriate safety equipment for repair, maintenance, alteration and addition works to enhance occupational safety awareness among ethnic minorities.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at the seminar, the Acting Commissioner for Labour, Mr Vincent Fung, said that the ethnic minority community is vital to the city&#39;s workforce, and their occupational safety and well-being must be safeguarded. He emphasised that occupational safety and health (OSH) is a shared duty, and that employers and employees should work together to build a safety culture. The LD will continue to enhance occupational safety through inspections, enforcement, publicity and promotion, as well as education and training. He also took the opportunity to urge eligible voters to cast their ballots in the Legislative Council Elections on December 7, selecting capable and competent representatives who can contribute to Hong Kong&#39;s occupational safety standards and the city&#39;s prosperity.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the seminar, a representative of the LD outlined the safety legislations on OSH, while a representative of the OSHC introduced various sponsorship schemes for small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) and OSH Star Enterprise Schemes, encouraging all SMEs across Hong Kong to participate and proactively improve their OSH practices.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A safety equipment exhibition was held at the venue, showcasing different types of equipment such as a light-duty working platform, a step platform, transportable temporary anchor devices and a full body safety harness, allowing participants to experience firsthand the effectiveness of the equipment.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102400522_photo_1315814.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102400522_photo_1315814.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102400522_photo_1315815.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102400522_photo_1315815.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102400522_photo_1315817.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102400522_photo_1315817.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102400522_photo_1315816.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102400522_photo_1315816.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Civil Aid Service (CAS) Cadet Corps held the 150th New Cadets Passing-out Parade at the CAS Headquarters today (October 25). Over 120 cadets participated in the parade. The parade was reviewed by the Deputy Director of Fire Services (Operations), Mr Derek Armstrong Chan.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking at the parade, Mr Chan congratulated all the new cadets on completing their training. He said the Cadet Corps has effectively enhanced the confidence and sense of responsibility of its members through foot drill and team-building training programmes, which are beneficial to their future academic and career development.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He also pointed out that the CAS and the Fire Services Department have all along been working closely in rescue operations during typhoons and floods. Whether in emergency rescue operations or recovery efforts after storms, the two departments collaborated seamlessly, fully demonstrating a people-oriented approach and a professional spirit of shouldering responsibility.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The CAS Cadet Corps has been committed to promoting diverse activities, including environmental initiatives such as coastal clean-ups by kayaking and tree planting, as well as organising various Mainland and overseas exchange programmes. These efforts aim to nurture cadets to become the next generation of patriots with a global perspective. Through these training programmes and activities, the Cadet Corps nurtures its members to become confident, self-disciplined and effective communicators in society.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Chan also reminded participants of the Passing-out Parade that the Legislative Council General Election will be held on December 7. It is of utmost importance for accelerating the development of Hong Kong&#39;s economy and improving people&#39;s livelihood. Mr Chan called on members of the public to cast their vote on that day.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recruitment of CAS cadets is open for application throughout the year. Recruitment details and application forms are available on the CAS website (<a href="https://www.cas.gov.hk/eng/org/cadet_corps.html" target="_blank">www.cas.gov.hk/eng/org/cadet_corps.html</a>).<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315818.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315818.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315819.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315819.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315820.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315820.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315821.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315821.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315822.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315822.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315823.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500398_photo_1315823.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹The Main Media Centre (MMC) in Hong Kong competition region of the 15th National Games (NG) will be officially commenced its operation tomorrow (October 26), and stays open until November 23.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upholding the spirit of implementation of green initiatives in organising the 15th NG, the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG), the MMC is converted from the Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park Sports Centre (SYSMPSC).ã€€ã€€<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MMC consists of the Main Press Centre and the International Broadcast Centre. The former provides work stations, press positions, press conference room and other facilities for registered media and broadcasters, and will live broadcast competitions as well as provide live results and information about the competitions. The International Broadcast Centre will serve as the main broadcast control room of the 15th NG, 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG, and will be operated by the host broadcaster, China Central Television, for consolidating broadcast signals from all venues in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. Four rights-holding broadcasters, including three local free television broadcasters and Radio Television Hong Kong, have been conferred the broadcasting rights, enabling them to broadcast the 15th NG for free locally.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of Mainland and overseas media practitioners are expected to visit Hong Kong for coverage of the 15th NG, 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG. The MMC, located next to the Victoria Harbour, will allow media to incorporate Hong Kong&#39;s iconic scenery into their coverage, showcasing the city&#39;s charm. The MMC also features a distinctive &quot;Hong Kong Street&quot; dining area, serving local cuisine. There are also a National Games History Gallery, showcasing the history of the National Games, and a licensed merchandise retail shop selling limited-edition merchandise and souvenirs.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, shuttle bus service is provided at the MMC for registered media traveling to and from various competition venues and hotels for media.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 15th NG, the SYSMPSC will be transformed into the MMC of the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG. Four competition events of the NSOG are hosted by Hong Kong competition region, namely NGD events boccia, wheelchair fencing, para table tennis (TT11), and NSOG event table tennis.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500357_photo_1315807.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500357_photo_1315807.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowing along Adelaide&#39;s River Torrens, the striking 40-metre-long Hong Kong Dragon Lantern is once again a major highlight of the Moon Lantern Trail at this year&#39;s OzAsia Festival from October 17 to November 2. The display showcases Hong Kong&#39;s unique position as a cultural bridge between East and West, while also honouring the growing creative collaboration between Hong Kong and Australia.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OzAsia Festival, organised by the Adelaide Festival Centre, stands as a leading international arts festival in Australia. The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, Sydney (Sydney ETO) is proud to once again be part of the Festival, bringing Hong Kong&#39;s creativity to Adelaide through the stunning Hong Kong Dragon Lantern showcased at the Festival&#39;s iconic Moon Lantern Trail.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at the OzAsia Festival Opening Night, the Director of the Sydney ETO, Mr Ricky Chong, said that the Sydney ETO has long supported initiatives that advance Hong Kong&#39;s role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange under the National 14th Five-Year Plan. The Sydney ETO was pleased to support contemporary art platform Hong Kong Soul at the Adelaide Fringe and the Hong Kong String Orchestra performing in Adelaide earlier this year. These exchanges strengthen cultural ties and foster lasting friendship between Hong Kong and South Australia.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He introduced the key measures announced in &quot;The Chief Executive&#39;s 2025 Policy Address&quot; to promote the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism, generating fresh economic momentum and further enhancing Hong Kong&#39;s global appeal. Mr Chong noted that the Kai Tak Sports Park, the largest sports infrastructure project ever built in Hong Kong, has already opened its doors and hosted a series of major events. Hong Kong will also cohost the National Games with Guangdong and Macao, which will take place next month.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong remarked that with direct flights between Adelaide and Hong Kong soon to resume, there is no better time to experience Hong Kong&#39;s vibrant energy and cultural dynamism.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held annually over three weeks (October 17 to November 9), the OzAsia Festival is Australia&#39;s leading contemporary arts festival that engages with Asia. This year&#39;s festival presents a rich programme spanning theatre, dance, music, visual arts, literature, cuisine, and cultural events from across the region. The vibrant line-up features more than 200 artists from Australia and abroad including Hong Kong, with six world premieres to be staged.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315798.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315798.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315797.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315797.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315804.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315804.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315796.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315796.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315795.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500197_photo_1315795.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) is conducting an in-depth investigation into an accident involving a B744 cargo aircraft (flight number UAE9788), arriving from Al Maktoum International Airport, United Arab Emirates, which deviated from the North Runway of Hong Kong International Airport after landing and ditched into the sea on October 20, in order to determine the circumstances and causes of the accident.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After detailed planning and coordination, the professional team commissioned by the Airport Authority Hong Kong is carrying out the salvage operation to remove the cargo aircraft involved in the incident, in order to enable the AAIA to conduct further inspections and an in-depth investigation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To expedite the collection of data required for the investigation, the AAIA successfully retrieved the Flight Data Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder, commonly known as the &quot;black boxes&quot;, from the aircraft wreckage late last night (October 24). There is water ingress into the two &quot;black boxes&quot;. The AAIA has promptly sent the devices to the laboratory for preliminary examination to determine the next course of action.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Experts will conduct in-depth analysis of the collected data, including reconstructing the sequence of events through the data from the &quot;black boxes&quot;, interviews with relevant personnel, laboratory findings, examination of the aircraft wreckage, aircraft operating procedures, aircraft system status and maintenance records, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, to prepare a report.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Annex 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the investigation into this accident is being led by the AAIA, which is also responsible for the dissemination of information. Notifications have been issued to the State of Registry, the State of the Operator, the State of Design and the State of Manufacture of the aircraft in accordance with Annex 13. Investigative authorities from these countries have appointed accredited representatives and experts to participate in the investigation and provide professional advice. Personnel from the National Transportation Safety Board of the United States and the Transport Safety Investigation Center of T&uuml;rkiye have arrived in Hong Kong, while experts from Boeing are also participating.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Following the successful recovery of the &#39;black boxes&#39;, the subsequent data processing, along with a thorough analysis and integration of other evidence, will take time. We will release a preliminary investigation report within one month and continue to conduct a thorough and rigorous investigation to determine the sequence of events and causes of the accident, as well as to propose safety recommendations to enhance aviation safety,&quot; an AAIA spokesperson said.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AAIA, an independent investigation authority formed under the Transport and Logistics Bureau, is responsible for the investigation of civil aircraft accidents and incidents in accordance with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations (Cap. 448B) and with reference to the International Civil Aviation Organization&#39;s standards. Pursuant to the Hong Kong Civil Aviation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations (Cap. 448B), the AAIA is responsible for investigating all aircraft accidents and incidents occurring within Hong Kong territory, including those involving passenger aircraft, cargo aircraft, business jet and general aviation (such as light aircraft and helicopters), regardless of whether the aircraft is registered in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the State of Registry, the State of the Operator, the State of Design and the State of Manufacture of the aircraft involved in the accident or incident may appoint accredited representatives to participate in investigations.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500013_photo_1315793.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500013_photo_1315793.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500013_photo_1315794.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/25/P2025102500013_photo_1315794.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delegation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, led by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, today (October 24) concluded its three-day visit to Beijing and Hebei.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, the delegation visited the Xiong&#39;an Urban Computing (Supercomputing Cloud) Center to learn how the Xiong&#39;an New Area is enhancing urban development and management through digitalisation. They then toured the Zhongguancun Science Park in Xiong&#39;an, where they were briefed on the park&#39;s overall planning and development, operational management, investment promotion strategies and the status of enterprise settlement.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delegation was also invited to attend a seminar. There, the Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xu Qifang, delivered remarks. The seminar was hosted by member of the Party Leadership Group and Vice-Governor of the People&#39;s Government of Hebei Province, Mr Zhao Dachun. At the seminar, Mr Chan and other delegation members shared their observations and insights from their visits to the Beijing Municipal Administrative Center and the Xiong&#39;an New Area. They discussed how Hong Kong can draw inspiration from the integration of above-ground and underground spatial planning, the alignment of spatial and industrial layouts, industry development policies, investment incentives, smart city initiatives, and innovative institutional mechanisms - in order to accelerate the development of Hong Kong&rsquo;s Northern Metropolis.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan remarked that under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; framework, Hong Kong&#39;s international advantages - including its capital, talent and professional services - can offer strong support to the industries and enterprises of both the Beijing Municipal Administrative Center and the Xiong&#39;an New Area as they expand globally. He added that there is great potential for mutual learning, exchange and collaborative development in areas such as finance, innovation and technology, trade and urban management.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, the Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Xia Baolong, met with Mr Chan and other delegation officials in Beijing.

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) under the Health Bureau announced today (October 24) that the Family Medicine Out-patient Services Priority Groups Pilot Scheme of the Hospital Authority (HA)&#39;s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services will be launched on November 4, it set the priority groups of underprivileged population in need of public primary healthcare services which could make priority booking for FMOP Services.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the needs of the underprivileged group in seeking consultation, the HA will launch the Pilot Scheme to allocate as appropriate some of the priority quotas to the priority groups. Priority groups include recipients of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme, recipients of the Old Age Living Allowance aged 75 or above, Level 0 Voucher Holders of the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly, and recipients of the Working Family Allowance (WFA) Scheme (the priority group eligibility for WFA Scheme recipients is valid for 12 months from the issue dates of their grant application letters).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals belonging to the priority groups can be eligible in the Pilot Scheme, and make priority bookings for FMOP episodic consultations, after registering as members of District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) and as priority group members for FMOP Services via the eHealth mobile application (eHealth app) or in person at DHCs. When making an appointment, registered individuals may first select their respective priority group through the booking system of the eHealth app. The system will then connect to the &quot;HA Go&quot; mobile application to make a booking for FMOP episodic consultations and the process does not require them to re-enter personal information. The system will offer priority quotas based on individual&#39;s eligibility as priority groups (refer to Annex). Consultation fees will be charged according to the standard rates of FMOPs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants in the Pilot Scheme can also join activities organised by DHCs to better manage their own health. The Government had successfully set up DHCs in all districts across the city by the end of 2022. Each DHC will set up several satellite centres/service points, mainly providing health promotion, health risk assessment, disease screening, chronic disease management and community rehabilitation services and more. For more details, please visit the <a href="https://www.dhc.gov.hk/en/" target="_blank">DHC website</a>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Healthcare Blueprint proposed developing a prevention-oriented primary healthcare system, and repositioning the HA&#39;s General Out-patient Clinic services to prioritise serving underprivileged groups. The Pilot Scheme is a major initiative according to the implementation plan of the Blueprint. Together with the HA&#39;s General Out-patient Clinic and Family Medicine Specialist Clinic services, which were unified under the name &quot;FMOP Services&quot; earlier this month, these measures mark that Family Medicine will be the core of the public primary healthcare, the team of FMOP will serve as family doctors for underprivileged groups, providing those in need with people-centered &nbsp;and prevention-focus &nbsp;healthcare services.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the PHC Commission and the HA will closely monitor and evaluate its effectiveness and the utilisation of priority quotas. They will also reserve priority quotas as appropriate and adjust the proportion of priority quotas based on needs and the actual situation, with a view to ensuring that the priority groups will be benefited.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400605_photo_1315736.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400605_photo_1315736.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to media inquiries regarding the latest situation of the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (SIV) School Outreach Programme, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 24) gave the following response:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
All schools may choose to use live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines)<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further optimise the School Outreach Programme, this year all schools may opt for the LAIV nasal vaccines and the &quot;hybrid mode&quot;, which allows schools to choose both the injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and the LAIV during the same or different outreach vaccination activities. So far, the CHP has not received any reports from schools or medical teams indicating that supply issues have prevented the arrangement of the LAIV nasal vaccine.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
School outreach activities this season will generally be completed earlier than last season<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To boost SIV rates, enrolment for the SIV School Outreach Programme has started since the beginning of June this year, which was earlier than last year. With the concerted efforts of the Government and various community sectors (including the medical sector and schools), approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) are going to arrange SIV school outreach activities. Among these, about 1 350 schools (59 per cent) have scheduled to carry out the outreach activities by the end of this month, and over 2 190 schools (95 per cent) by the end of next month (November), which are respectively higher than last year&#39;s 45 per cent and 83 per cent. All in all, this season&#39;s school outreach activities will generally be completed earlier than last season&#39;s.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the start of the school year, about 930 schools have held SIV school outreach activities, which is higher than of 650 compared to the same period in the last season. In view of this year&#39;s summer influenza season, coupled with the recent increase in seasonal influenza activity and the number of school outbreaks, the CHP has actively contacted the schools in mid-October, urging them to try to further advance school outreach activities where feasible. Currently, 23 schools have responded to the CHP&#39;s call to advance their outreach activities, originally scheduled for December this year or January next year, to be held by the end of next month.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHP expressed sincere gratitude to the schools and medical institutions which co-operated to advance vaccination activities. The CHP understands that participating schools have to take into account various objective factors such as the school calendar and staffing when scheduling school outreach activities, and coordinate with participating medical teams on the appropriate time. Should schools encounter any difficulties in advancing their outreach activities, they may contact the CHP during office hours at 3975 4872 and the CHP will provide full assistance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Vaccine supply is subject to pharmaceutical companies&#39; production schedules<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Organization (WHO) usually announces the seasonal influenza virus strains for the Northern Hemisphere from February to March each year. Pharmaceutical companies worldwide then produce appropriate vaccines based on the WHO&#39;s announcement for public procurement. Due to the time required for production and transportation, experience shows that vaccines normally arrive in different countries and regions between September and October the earliest. In the past two years, the CHP has actively engaged with pharmaceutical manufacturers with a view to secure vaccines as early as possible. This year, the CHP received the vaccines around mid-September.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHP will continue to closely monitor the vaccine supply at the international level and the implementation of the SIV School Outreach Programme, striving to ensure stable vaccine supply and enhance the flexibility of the School Outreach Programme in order to meet the vaccination needs of different groups and better safeguard public health.]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two incoming male passengers were sentenced to four months&#39; and five months&#39; imprisonment and fined $1,000 respectively by the West Kowloon Magistrates&#39; Courts today (October 24) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes, failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs officers intercepted a 29-year-old and a 30-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on August 14. About 29 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 25 800 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $197,000 and a duty potential of about $97,000 and about 28 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes and about 43 000 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $247,000 and a duty potential of about $95,000 in total, were seized from their personal baggage respectively. The passengers were subsequently arrested. The 29-year-old passenger was sentenced to four months&#39; imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the court today while the 30-year-old passenger was sentenced to five months&#39; imprisonment and fined $1,000.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs&#39; 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (<a href="mailto:crimereport@customs.gov.hk">crimereport@customs.gov.hk</a>) or online form (<a href="https://eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en/" target="_blank">eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002</a>).<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400692_photo_1315789.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400692_photo_1315789.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400692_photo_1315790.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400692_photo_1315790.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongkong Post today (October 24) appealed to members of the public to stay alert to a fraudulent job advertisement published on a recruitment website.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fraudulent job advertisement concerned was about recruitment of postal assistant clerks to work in the Kowloon Bay Post Office for production and delivery of philatelic products, etc. Hongkong Post clarifies that it had not published the job advertisement in question.

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 24) reported the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).<br />
<br />
Chikungunya fever<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 5pm today, one new case of CF had been recorded.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The case involves a 44-year-old female living in Yuen Long District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Kweiping in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region between September 20 and October 19. She has developed a fever, joint pain and rash since October 22, and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Pok Oi Hospital yesterday (October 23). Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient is now in stable condition and is being arranged for treatment in a mosquito-free environment.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the patient stayed in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP&#39;s epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of the Mainland.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 44 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. Among which, a patient passed away, while conditions of other patients are mild.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients&#39; underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.<br />
<br />
Dengue fever<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From October 17 to yesterday (October 23), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to Yunfu in Guangdong Province during the incubation period.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of yesterday, 50 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over 4 million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 40 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.&nbsp;Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 2 181 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 383 cases were recorded in a week between October 6 to 12, with the highest number of cases recorded in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Jiangmen and Dongguan.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/df_imported_cases_and_overseas_figures_eng.pdf" target="_blank">website</a>.<br />
<br />
Continuously strengthening prevention and control<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients of DF and CF, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>carrying out intensive fogging in&nbsp;scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;</li>
	<li>carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and</li>
	<li>enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.</li>
</ul>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹Additionally, the CHP&#39;s Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and reminds cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:<br />
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>read the label instructions carefully first;</li>
	<li>apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;</li>
	<li>apply on exposed skin and clothing;</li>
	<li>use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);</li>
	<li>apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;</li>
	<li>reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and</li>
	<li>in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.</li>
</ul>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.<br />

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed &quot;Rally&quot;, &quot;Lightshadow&quot;, &quot;Puncture&quot;, and a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed &quot;Champion&quot;, from October 17 to yesterday (October 23). As of yesterday (October 23), a&nbsp;total of 11 suspected illegal workers, four suspected employers and a suspected aider and abettor were arrested.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ImmD officers found that social media platforms have recently been utilised by Mainland photographers to advertise photography and makeup services in Hong Kong. After an in-depth investigation and intelligence analysis, ImmD officers identified several suspected persons and initiated an operation. Officers disguised themselves as customers to enquire about and book photography and makeup services from these Mainland photographers and makeup artists. They were subsequently arrested while providing photography and makeup services in Hong Kong. The five arrested illegal workers comprised three men and two women, aged 20 to 29.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers also raided multiple target locations including restaurants, residential buildings and construction sites, etc. Six suspected illegal workers, four suspected employers and a suspected aider and abettor were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and four women, aged 24 to 47. Two men and two women, aged 36 to 62, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. Furthermore, the suspected aider and abettor arrested was a women aged 56.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An ImmD spokesman said, &quot;Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years&#39; imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spokesman warned, &quot;As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years&#39; imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. &quot;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years&#39; imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years&#39; imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee&#39;s identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker&#39;s valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹The Home Affairs Department (HAD) today (October 24) held a launching ceremony for the second-term District Services &amp; Community Care Teams (Care Teams) at the Central Government Offices. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, accompanied by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, officiated at the ceremony.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the launching ceremony, Mr Lee said that when he ran in the Chief Executive Election in 2022, he proposed in his election manifesto to set up Care Teams in the 18 districts. Care Teams had already become an integral part of the Government&#39;s efforts to improve district governance. Under the enhanced district governance structure, the District Councils, the &quot;three district committees&quot;, and Care Teams each have well-defined roles while maintaining close co-ordination and synergy in helping those in need. This governance structure enables the Government services to be rooted in the community, reach out to the public and accurately and effectively provide relief measures and solutions. Each Care Team actively provided and organised caring and community activities, reached out and helped the underprivileged, disseminated government information, and assisted the Government in providing relief in times of incidents and emergencies. Mr Lee said the Care Teams serve without seeking reward and without fear of hardship, embodying the spirit of care and compassion.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further support the work of Care Teams, the Government has set up three additional Care Teams in accordance with district needs and enhanced the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the second-term of service, enabling Care Teams to provide services and activities better tailored to district needs. Under a regularised mode of operation and with increased government funding, the second-term service of Care Teams will further extend the community support network. The Government will also enhance training for Care Teams and facilitate them to strengthen ties and co-operation with government departments, public utilities and district organisations. Mr Lee expressed his hope that the Care Teams would continue to carry forward the spirit and strength of unity, mutual support, resilience and inclusiveness.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other officiating guests included the Under Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Mr Clarence Leung, and the Director of Home Affairs, Ms Priscilla To. District Officers of the 18 districts, who are the commanders of Care Teams in their districts, and the representative of all 455 Care Teams also attended the ceremony.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-term of Care Team services has completed and all KPIs have been met. Care Teams have made around 610 000 visits to elderly households and other households in need, provided close to 100 000 times of basic home or other support services, organised around 50 000 district-level activities, and their achievements are evident to all.&nbsp;The HAD and District Offices will consolidate the reports of the Care Teams in the first term and let the public know their achievements.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second-term service of Care Teams will run till September 30, 2027. Building on the established district networks, Care Teams will continue to deepen and broaden their services to further enhance people&#39;s sense of satisfaction and well-being.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400608_photo_1315786.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400608_photo_1315786.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400608_photo_1315787.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400608_photo_1315787.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, today (October 24) joined the 2025 International Forum on Energy Transition cohosted by the National Energy Administration (NEA), the Jiangsu Provincial People&#39;s Government and the International Renewable Energy Agency in Suzhou.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theme for this year is &quot;A Decade of Collaboration Drives Energy Transitions for a Green Future &quot;. At the High-level Dialogue Session titled &quot;Building a Forward-Looking Framework for Global Clean Energy Cooperation&quot;, Mr Tse shared Hong Kong&#39;s strategies and progress in promoting regional energy collaboration.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tse introduced to the attendees the four major decarbonisation strategies outlined by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in the Hong Kong&#39;s Climate Action Plan 2050, namely net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport, and waste reduction, leading Hong Kong towards carbon neutrality.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In terms of net-zero electricity generation, Hong Kong has gradually phased out coal for daily electricity generation since 1997 and aims to increase the share of zero-carbon energy in the fuel mix for electricity generation to about 60 per cent. We are also committed to measures such as ceasing new registration of fuel-propelled private cars before 2035 and moving away from the reliance on landfills for municipal solid waste management, aiming to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035 and carbon neutrality before 2050,&quot; Mr Tse said.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned that the HKSAR formulated the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong last year to seize the opportunities brought about by the global development of hydrogen energy and create an environment conducive to the development of hydrogen energy in Hong Kong in a prudent and orderly manner. He said that he was looking forward to continuing to strengthen communication and collaboration with all parties involved in the development of new energy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tse added that, Hong Kong, as the world&#39;s third-most competitive international financial centre and international centre for green and sustainable finance, can become a hub for green technologies and products, and provide professional services for green development worldwide to work together to promote regional low-carbon green transformation.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, Mr Tse signed the Cooperation Arrangement on Promoting Interconnectivity of Charging Facilities in the Greater Bay Area with Deputy Administrator of the National Energy Administration of China Mr Song Hongkun.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Arrangement, the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the NEA will establish a joint working group to develop a roadmap for the demonstration project of the new electric vehicle charging technology, called ChaoJi, in Hong Kong and confirm the implementation details, which include conducting technical discussions with experts on the research, development, and certification of relevant adapters, as well as preparing for the next stage of work.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at the signing ceremony, Mr Tse said, &quot;By collaborating with the National Energy Administration to implement the Arrangement, the introduction of a pilot scheme in Hong Kong using the ChaoJi charging standard will help the HKSAR to address the issue of different electric vehicle charging standards between the two places in the long run, promote the construction of supporting infrastructure for new energy vehicles, and enhance the interconnectivity and green low-carbon transportation development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as well as to showcase the technical standard advantages of ChaoJi to the world, aiding the global advancement of China&#39;s electric vehicle technology and charging standards.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tse will return to Hong Kong tomorrow (October 25).<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315765.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315765.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315766.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315766.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315767.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315767.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315768.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315768.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315769.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400606_photo_1315769.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, continued his visit to Korea in Seoul today (October 24) to explore with the local legal sectors strengthening legal co-operation between Hong Kong and Korea. He also attended a joint legal workshop co-organised by the two places.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Mr Lam visited the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board (KCAB) International. He met with the Chairman of the KCAB International, Professor Chang Seung-wha, and had a luncheon together with representatives from the Korean Council of International Arbitration, to discuss promoting co-operation between Hong Kong and Korea in cross-border business dispute resolution and arbitration, and to explore enhancing co-operation in legal matters of the two places.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Mr Lam attended a joint legal workshop co-organised by the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea on &quot;Strengthening Business and Legal Cooperation: Korea and Hong Kong&quot;. The workshop attracted about 100 participants. Mr Lam said in his opening remarks that Hong Kong, as the only bilingual common law jurisdiction in the world using both English and Chinese, is home to a large pool of lawyers with extensive international experience, and maintains a close connection with the legal system in the Chinese Mainland. As the centre for international legal and dispute resolution in the Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong provides fair and efficient dispute resolution services that facilitate enterprises to expand investment and business opportunities in China. Looking forward, he said he expected the DoJ will continue building on a strong foundation of partnership with Korea.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lam then had dinner with the Deputy Minister of the International Legal Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, Mr Chung Hong-sik, during which they exchanged views on legal co-operation opportunities between Hong Kong and Korea, and the latest developments in legal and dispute resolution services.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lam will conclude his visit to Korea tomorrow morning (October 25) and return to Hong Kong.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315737.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315737.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315738.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315738.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315739.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315739.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315740.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315740.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315741.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315741.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315742.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315742.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315743.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315743.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315775.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315775.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315776.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400572_photo_1315776.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Department (ImmD) carried out repatriation operations from October 20 to today (October 24). A total of 90 unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants who were illegal immigrants and overstayers were repatriated to their places of origin. The persons removed comprised 46 men and 44 women. Among them were discharged prisoners who had committed criminal offences and had been sentenced to imprisonment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ImmD has been committed to promptly removing unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants from Hong Kong to maintain effective immigration control and safeguard the public interest. Under the updated removal policy effective from December 7, 2022, the ImmD may generally proceed with the removal of a claimant whose judicial review case has been dismissed by the Court of First Instance of the High Court, thereby enhancing the efficiency of and efforts in removing unsubstantiated claimants.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on circumstances and needs, the ImmD will remain committed to expediting the removal process and actively maintain close liaison with governments of major source countries of non-refoulement claimants, airline companies and other government departments to repatriate unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants from Hong Kong as soon as practicable through all appropriate measures.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400571_photo_1315763.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400571_photo_1315763.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400571_photo_1315764.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400571_photo_1315764.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the joint legal workshop co-organised by the Department of Justice and the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea on &quot;Strengthening Business and Legal Cooperation: Korea and Hong Kong&quot; in Seoul, Korea, today (October 24):<br />
<br />
Mr Chung (Deputy Minister of the International Legal Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, Mr Chung Hong-sik), Mr Jeong (Executive Director of the Trade Promotion Group of the Korea International Trade Association, Mr Jeong Hee-cheol), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good afternoon. It is my great honour and pleasure to welcome you all to the 2nd Joint Legal Workshop organised by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, the Department of Justice of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the Korea International Trade Association and the Korea In-House Counsel Association. Our theme today is &quot;Strengthening Business and Legal Cooperation: Korea and Hong Kong&quot;.&nbsp; Building on the success of our first legal workshop held in Hong Kong in July last year, this event marks a significant step forward in our ongoing partnership.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korea has always been a close partner of Hong Kong. In 2024, Korea was Hong Kong&#39;s fifth largest trading partner. The total merchandise trade between Hong Kong and Korea reached HK$355.9 billion in 2024, representing a nearly 20 per cent increase from the previous year. This reflects the deepening economic exchanges and expanding opportunities between our two regions.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate these increasing exchanges and the exploration of these opportunities, and to safeguard the rights and interests of all relevant stakeholders, it is plain and obvious that reliable, high-quality and user-friendly legal and dispute resolution services are indispensable. This is precisely what Hong Kong may and can offer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fundamental principle of &quot;one country, two systems&quot;, Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in the People&#39;s Republic of China. It is also the only bilingual common law jurisdiction in the world using both English and Chinese. We have an independent judiciary with the power of final adjudication, business-friendly civil and commercial laws familiar to the international community, and a large pool of lawyers with extensive international experience and expertise in different areas. These legal professionals provide seamless, one-stop services across a wide range of matters covering the whole business cycle, from the formation of a business entity (including the raising of capital by public listing) to the realisation of profits derived from a business venture.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair and efficient dispute resolution services constitute an essential component of risk management. Apart from traditional litigations, alternative dispute resolution including arbitration and mediation have become increasingly important in international trade and investment. Hong Kong has all along been well regarded as one of the top international arbitration centres in the world. According to the 2025 International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong ranks as the second most preferred seat for arbitration globally and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2024, 76.4 per cent of the arbitrations submitted to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre were international in nature.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to mediation, the establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong demonstrates the city&#39;s unique advantages and opportunities in international mediation. The IOMed is the world&#39;s first intergovernmental international legal organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes, including disputes between a country and another country, a country and foreign nationals, as well as international commercial disputes, through mediation. The headquarters of IOMed has been established in Hong Kong, and IOMed formally opened a few days ago on October 20. We are also excited to share the news that we will construct the Hong Kong International Legal Service Building, adjacent to the IOMed headquarters, to house international legal and dispute resolution services institutions so as to further support Hong Kong&#39;s strategic position as a centre for international legal and dispute resolution.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unique and significant advantage enjoyed by Hong Kong is its close connection with the legal system in the Chinese Mainland. Up to the present, Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland have signed nine mutual legal assistance arrangements, including mutual recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial judgments as well as arbitral awards; and the grant of interim measures in arbitrations, which is extremely useful in practice. All in all, Hong Kong&#39;s legal and dispute resolution services may be conveniently used to facilitate the exploitation of investment and business opportunities in the Chinese Mainland. This is why we say Hong Kong indeed serves as a gateway between China and the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the Department of Justice is eager to continue building on the strong foundation of partnership we have with Korea. On this basis, I would like to take the opportunity to invite all of you to join us at our annual flagship event &mdash; Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 &mdash; which will be held from December 1 to 5, 2025, in Hong Kong.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our co-organisers of the workshop, the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea, the Korea International Trade Association and the Korea In-House Counsel Association for their efforts in making this workshop possible; and, of course, all our distinguished speakers who will share their valuable insights in the two panel discussions. I wish you all a very productive and inspiring session ahead. Thank you.<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400560_photo_1315740.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400560_photo_1315740.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Kong Customs on September 20 detected two smuggling cases involving two passengers at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and seized 1 250 syringes and 1 275 syringes of pharmaceutical injections containing Part I Poisons respectively from each passenger. The total estimated market value was about $1.77 million. The two passengers concerned were both convicted and sentenced to 10 weeks&#39; imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates&#39; Courts today (October 24) for contravening the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) (Cap. 60). All the pharmaceutical products were confiscated.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs officers intercepted the two male passengers, both aged 28, on September 20 at the Arrival Hall at HKIA for Customs clearance. Upon examination, the pharmaceutical injections were found inside their respective personal baggage.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs reminds the public not to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the IEO, any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs&#39; 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (<a href="mailto:crimereport@customs.gov.hk">crimereport@customs.gov.hk</a>) or online form (<a href="https://eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en/" target="_blank">eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002</a>).<div id="photos"><a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400538_photo_1315744.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400538_photo_1315744.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400538_photo_1315745.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202510/24/P2025102400538_photo_1315745.jpg" style="max-width:320px;max-height:320px" alt="Photo" border="1" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>]]>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the fifth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 12 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FEHD has so far released five batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 44 survey areas. Among these 44 survey areas, 32 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas&#39; mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Twelve other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:
<ul>
	<li>tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;</li>
	<li>remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;</li>
	<li>check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;</li>
	<li>change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;</li>
	<li>properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and</li>
	<li>properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€‹Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department&#39;s webpage (<a href="https://www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#" target="_blank">www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#</a>).]]>

                <![CDATA[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The &quot;Immersive Hong Kong&quot; roving exhibition, organised by the Information Services Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government to showcase the diversity and latest developments of Hong Kong through interactive art technology, opened in Chengdu today (October 24).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Co-organised with the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Chengdu, the exhibition, themed &quot;Hong Kong - Where the World Looks Ahead&quot;, invites visitors from Chengdu and throughout Sichuan Province to explore the unique opportunities and potential for tourism, education, business and investment in Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The exhibition enables visitors to delve into different virtual scenes representing the city, with a creative twist. The five thematic zones are &quot;Financial Bridgehead&quot;, &quot;I&amp;T Brain Bank&quot;, &quot;Blossoming Creativity&quot;, &quot;Diversity and Greenery&quot; and &quot;Buzzing Sports Action&quot;. They feature multiple interactive art projections, light box installations and naked-eye 3D displays, representing the distinctive appeal of Hong Kong.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visitors may also enjoy Hong Kong&#39;s vibrant and colourful skyline, illustrated by Hong Kong artist Messy Desk (Jane Lee), at a photo corner in the venue. Promotional videos and digital panels presenting information about the city, as well as insights from Chinese Mainland companies about their experiences in Hong Kong are also on display, highlighting why the city is one of the most desirable places to visit, study, live, work and invest.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Speaking at the opening ceremony today, the Director of Information Services, Mrs Apollonia Liu, noted that this year marks the 10th anniversary edition of the Belt and Road Summit organised by the HKSAR. As such, three node cities along the Belt and Road on the Mainland were selected to hold the exhibition. The first two stops were successfully held in Shanghai and Qingdao respectively, attracting a total of almost 300 000 visitors.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We are delighted to bring the roving exhibition to Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan,&quot; Mrs Liu said. &quot;Since the establishment of the Hong Kong/Sichuan Co-operation Conference mechanism in 2018, the co-operation and communication between Sichuan and Hong Kong have been strengthening steadily. The two places have reached consensus on strengthening various co-operation areas, including the economic, trade, and the Belt and Road Initiative. Data from 2024 shows that Hong Kong is Sichuan&#39;s largest source of external investment and the fourth-largest export area. As of May 2025, more than 40 Sichuan enterprises have been listed in Hong Kong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs Liu added that Sichuan is the world&#39;s largest and most complete habitat for giant pandas. The giant panda is a national treasure that embodies profound Chinese culture and ecological significance, connecting compatriots from the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong citizens. The six giant pandas in Hong Kong, including four from Chengdu and a pair of twins born to two of them, are beloved by both residents and tourists. As such, the exhibition has incorporated elements of the giant panda for visitors in Chengdu to learn more about the pandas in Hong Kong.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs Liu pointed out that Hong Kong and Chengdu are both sports event hubs, staging high-quality events this year. In August, Chengdu hosted the 2025 World Games for the first time, while Hong Kong will cohost the 15th National Games with Guangdong and Macao next month. The &quot;Buzzing Sports Action&quot; thematic zone of the exhibition serves as pre-event publicity for the National Games.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To enhance Chengdu residents&#39; understanding of Hong Kong&#39;s arts and cultural landmark - the West Kowloon Cultural District, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority has also set up a display area at the venue. It showcases the unique features of the cultural district through engaging ways such as a photo corner and a capsule toy game.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A Hong Kong pop music concert by SENZA A Cappella will also be staged at the exhibition venue this weekend.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs Liu expressed hope that the exhibition would spark the interest of friends from Chengdu to learn more about Hong Kong and visit the city. She also said she hopes that Sichuan and Hong Kong would continue to leverage on and integrate their unique advantages to foster win-win co-operation outcomes in various fields.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the exhibition, visitors can take part in an interactive game, &quot;Snap a cool shot @Immersive Hong Kong&quot;, with exciting prizes on offer. Prizes include two pairs of round-trip business or economy class air tickets from Chengdu to Hong Kong sponsored by Cathay Pacific, and sets of six giant panda figurines. Visitors playing digital interactive games at the exhibition can also receive souvenirs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The exhibition is being held at the MixC, a major shopping centre in Chengdu, until November 2. Admission is free.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chengdu is the eighth stop of the exhibition, following successful events in seven cities on the Chinese Mainland, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Middle East between July 2023 and July 2025.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supporting organisations of the exhibition include the Belt and Road Office of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Hong Kong Talent Engage, Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Kai Tak Sports Park and the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority.<br />

            <description>
                <![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Census and Statistics Department (C&amp;SD) released today (October 24) the results of the Quarterly Business Tendency Survey for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2025.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Business Situation<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all surveyed sectors taken together, the proportion of respondents expecting their business situation to be better (13%) in Q4 2025 over the preceding quarter is slightly lower than that expecting it to be worse (15%).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When compared with the results of the Q3 2025 survey round, the proportion of respondents expecting a better business situation in Q4 2025 is 13%, higher than the corresponding proportion in Q3 2025 (10%). At the same time, the proportion of respondents expecting a worse business situation had decreased from 18% in Q3 2025 to 15% in Q4 2025.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysed by sector, respondents in quite a number of the surveyed sectors expect their business situation to decrease on balance in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025. In particular, significantly more respondents in the construction sector expect their business situation to be worse in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025. On the other hand, in the retail, financing and insurance and accommodation and food services sectors, more respondents expect their business situation to be better, as compared to those expecting it to be worse.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. In this type of survey on expectations, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents&#39; perception of the future accords with the underlying trends. The enumeration period for this survey round was from September 2, 2025 to October 10, 2025.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Volume of Business / Output<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysed by sector, the number of surveyed sectors with respondents expecting their volume of business/output to decrease on balance in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025 is broadly the same as the number of surveyed sectors expecting their volume of business/output to increase. In particular, more respondents in the construction, information and communications and manufacturing sectors expect their volume of construction output/business/production to decrease in Q4 2025 over Q3 2025. On the contrary, in the real estate, retail, accommodation and food services and financing and insurance sectors, more respondents expect their volume of business/sales to increase, as compared to those expecting it to decrease.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Employment<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondents in quite a number of the surveyed sectors expect their employment to remain broadly unchanged in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025. However, more respondents in the retail and professional and business services sectors expect their employment to decrease in Q4 2025 over Q3 2025. In the manufacturing and real estate sectors, on the other hand, more respondents expect their employment to increase, as compared to those expecting it to decrease.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Selling Price / Service Charge<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondents in most of the surveyed sectors expect their selling prices/service charges to remain broadly unchanged in Q4 2025 as compared with Q3 2025. However, significantly more respondents in the construction sector expect their tender prices to go down in Q4 2025 over Q3 2025.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Commentary<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Government spokesman said that the overall near-term business outlook among large enterprises improved for the fourth quarter of 2025. The hiring appetite was largely steady on the whole.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, the spokesman said that local business sentiment will be well underpinned by the sustained expansion in various segments of the Hong Kong economy, notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties in the external environment. The Government will monitor the situation closely.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Further Information<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey gathers views on short-term business performance from the senior management of about 560 prominent companies in various sectors in Hong Kong with a view to providing a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for predicting the short-term future economic performance of the local economy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey covers 10 major sectors in Hong Kong, namely manufacturing; construction; import / export trade and wholesale; retail; accommodation and food services (mainly covering services rendered by hotels and restaurants); transportation, storage and courier services; information and communications; financing and insurance; real estate; and professional and business services sectors.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Views collected in the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in, and are limited to the expected direction of quarter-to-quarter change (e.g. &quot;up&quot;, &quot;same&quot; or &quot;down&quot;) but not the magnitude of change. In collecting views on the quarter-to-quarter changes, if the variable in question is subject to seasonal variations, respondents are asked to provide the expected changes after excluding the normal seasonal variations.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survey results are generally presented as &quot;net balance&quot;, i.e. the difference between the percentage of respondents choosing &quot;up&quot; and that choosing &quot;down&quot;. The percentage distribution of respondents among various response categories (e.g. &quot;up&quot;, &quot;same&quot; and &quot;down&quot;) reflects how varied their business expectations are. The &quot;net balance&quot;, with its appropriate sign, indicates the direction of expected change in the variable concerned. A positive sign indicates a likely upward trend while a negative sign indicates a likely downward trend. However, the magnitude of the &quot;net balance&quot; reflects only the prevalence of optimism or pessimism, but not the magnitude of expected change, since information relating to such magnitude is not collected in the survey.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, owing to sample size constraint, care should be taken in interpreting survey results involving a small percentage (e.g. less than 10%) of respondents in individual sectors.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chart 1 shows the views on expected changes in business situation for the period Q4 2024 to Q4 2025.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1 shows the net balances of views on expectations in respect of different variables for Q4 2025.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey results are published in greater detail in the &quot;Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey, Q4 2025&quot;. Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&amp;SD (<a href="https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110008&amp;scode=300" target="_blank">www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110008&amp;scode=300</a>).<br />

                <![CDATA[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (October 24) released the latest grading of water quality for 39 gazetted beaches (see Note 1) and one non-gazetted beach (see Note 2).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty-four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), 15 as Fair (Grade 2) and one as Poor (Grade 3).<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Compared with the grading released last week, Butterfly Beach and Deep Water Bay Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1. Middle Bay Beach and Silverstrand Beach have been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2, and Approach Beach from Grade 2 to Grade 3.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,&quot; an EPD spokesman said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD&#39;s website on Beach Water Quality (<a href="https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach" target="_blank">www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach</a>) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD&#39;s dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (<a href="https://www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast" target="_blank">www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast</a>).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note 1: Lifesaving services are provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department at 27 gazetted beaches, marked with an asterisk (*) above, from September 1. For details, please refer to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department&#39;s Special Announcement (<a href="https://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/beach/index.html" target="_blank">www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/beach/index.html</a>).<br />

                <![CDATA[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In response to the Japanese Government&#39;s plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From noon on October 23 to noon today (October 24), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 173 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the &quot;aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt&quot; category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS&#39;s thematic website titled &quot;Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan&quot; (<a href="https://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html" target="_blank">www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html</a>).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 52 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD&#39;s website (<a href="https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html" target="_blank">www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html</a>).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO&#39;s website (<a href="https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html" target="_blank">www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html</a>).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 174 973 samples of food imported from Japan (including 114 078 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 39 310 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests.]]>

                <![CDATA[The following is issued on behalf of the Major Sports Events Committee:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Major Sports Events Committee (MSEC) has awarded &quot;M&quot; Mark status to the Link Hong Kong Open 2025 (October 30 to November 2), the Hong Kong Sixes 2025 (November 7 to 9), and the BLAST Premier Hong Kong Rivals 2025 (November 14 to 16).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the MSEC, Mr Wilfred Ng, said today (October 24), &quot;The &#39;M&#39; Mark events take place one after another. In the coming three weeks, we will first welcome three highly anticipated international sports events, namely the Link Hong Kong Open 2025, the Hong Kong Sixes 2025 and the BLAST Premier Hong Kong Rivals 2025. All these events gather top players from around the world, showcasing Hong Kong&#39;s professionalism in hosting international competitions and its international influence. Among these, the BLAST Premier Hong Kong Rivals 2025 will be the first e-sports tournament held in Hong Kong, which will bring a brand-new experience to both local citizens and global e-sports enthusiasts. I believe that the above sporting events will not only attract spectators from all over the globe, but also stimulate the local economy and drive growth in related sectors such as catering, retail and tourism, further enhancing Hong Kong&#39;s status as a capital of international sports events.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;M&quot; Mark System aims to encourage and help local National Sports Associations and private or non-government organisations to organise more major international sports events and nurture them into sustainable undertakings. Sports events meeting the assessment criteria will be considered for &quot;M&quot; Mark status by the MSEC. Funding support will also be provided to some events. The &quot;M&quot; Mark System aims to promote the development of major sports events, cultivate a sustainable sporting culture, enhance Hong Kong&#39;s image as a centre for major international sports events and bring tangible economic benefits to our community.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For details of &quot;M&quot; Mark events, please visit <a href="https://www.mevents.org.hk/en/index.php" target="_blank">www.mevents.org.hk</a>.&nbsp;<br />

                <![CDATA[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) today (October 24) announced an adjustment to the auto-LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations from November 1 to 30, 2025, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contracts for dedicated LPG filling stations.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A department spokesman said that the adjustment on November 1, 2025, would reflect the movement of the LPG international price in October 2025. The adjusted auto-LPG ceiling prices for dedicated LPG filling stations would range from $3.12 to $4.04 per litre, amounting to a decrease of $0.08 to $0.09 per litre.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spokesman said that the auto-LPG ceiling prices were adjusted according to a pricing formula specified in the contracts. The formula comprises two elements - the LPG international price and the LPG operating price. The LPG international price refers to the LPG international price of the preceding month. The LPG operating price is adjusted on February 1 and June 1 annually according to the average movement of the Composite Consumer Price Index and the Nominal Wage Index.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The auto-LPG ceiling prices for respective dedicated LPG filling stations in November 2025 are as follows:<br />

                <![CDATA[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An owner of a mini-storage unit was convicted and fined $59,960 in total, of which $23,960 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, by the Eastern Magistrates&#39; Courts yesterday (October 23) for failing to comply with a removal order and a repair order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The case involved an alteration of a mini-storage unit in an industrial building at Lee Chung Street and Cheung Lee Street, Chai Wan. As the alteration and addition works were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), and the works obstructed the means of escape and means of access for fire fighting and rescue as well as affecting the fire resisting construction of the building, contravening the Building (Planning) Regulations and the Building (Construction) Regulation, a removal order and a repair order were served on the owner under section 24(1) and section 26 of the BO respectively. Failing to comply with the statutory orders, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A spokesman for the BD said today (October 24), &quot;Unauthorised alteration works causing obstruction to the means of escape and means of access for fire fighting and rescue, or affecting the fire resisting construction of a building may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders and repair orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders and repair orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year&#39;s imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues. Moreover, failure to comply with a repair order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of level 5 ($50,000 at present) and one year&#39;s imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $5,000 for each day that the offence continues.]]>
